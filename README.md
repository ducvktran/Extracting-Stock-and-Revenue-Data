This project was done as an assignment for the online course "Python Project for Data Science" by IBM. Although the graphs created by `plotly` don't appear here, they should appear in a regular Jupyter Notebook environment. For a nicer view of the codes, please see [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/ducvktran/Extracting-Stock-and-Revenue-Data/blob/main/Extracting_Stock_and_Revenue_Data.ipynb).
